# Alpaca PHP SDK

This repository contains a PHP SDK for use with the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets?ref_by=858915e73e) API.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is **NOT** an official SDK, it is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Alpaca in any way.

## Installation

> __NOTE__: This package currently requires PHP >= 7.0.0
>
> If you have a need for PHP 5.x support let me know by opening an issue (or feel free to submit a pull request).

##### Via Composer

```shell
$ composer require jeffreyhyer/alpaca-trade-api-php
```

## Usage

From within your PHP application you can access the Alpaca API with just a couple of lines:

```php
<?php

require './vendor/autoload.php';

use Alpaca\Alpaca;

$alpaca = new Alpaca("--KEY--", "--SECRET--");

$positions = $alpaca->getPositions();
```

## API

### Constructor

To get started initialize the `Alpaca` class with your Alpaca Key and Secret. You can also set the third parameter to enable or disable paper trading. The default is `true` to enable calling against the paper trading endpoint.

```php
use Alpaca\Alpaca;

$alpaca = new Alpaca("KEY", "SECRET", true);

// This call will now work as expected if your KEY and SECRET are valid.
// If not, the response will contain an error explaining what went wrong.
$resp = $alpaca->getAccount();
```

You can change these values after initialization if necessary using the following methods:

##### `setKey($key)`

Set your Alpaca Key

##### `setSecret($secret)`

Set your Alpaca Secret

##### `setPaper(true)`

Enable or disable paper trading. `true` = Paper Trading, `false` = Live Trading.

---

### Response

All methods return an instance of the `\Alpaca\Response` class which has a number of convenient methods for working with the API response.

##### `getCode()`

Returns the HTTP status code of the request (e.g. `200`, `403`, etc).

##### `getReason()`

Returns the HTTP status reason of the request (e.g. `OK`, `Forbidden`, etc).

##### `getResponse()`

Returns the JSON decoded response. For example:

```php
print_r($alpaca->getAccount()->getResponse());

/*

    [status] => ACTIVE
